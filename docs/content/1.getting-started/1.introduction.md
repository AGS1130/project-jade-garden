## Outlook

The concept of Headless UI libraries has gained [considerable traction](https://npmtrends.com/@chakra-ui/react-vs-@mantine/core-vs-@mui/material-vs-@radix-ui/primitive){:target="_blank"}.
Libraries like [Headless UI](https://headlessui.com/){:target="_blank"} pioneered the approach of providing fully accessible, unstyled UI components: offering complete freedom for developers to apply their own styling solutions.
This concept reached widespread popularity with the emergence of [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/){:target="_blank"},
which leverages [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/){:target="_blank"} and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/){:target="_blank"} to create accessible components that you can customize and extend.

While shadcn/ui offers the advantage of code ownership and customization, it presents a long-term maintainence challenge front-end developers are familiar with: **overriding CSS**.
This issue is not unique to Tailwind CSS, as developers who have worked with [other libraries and frameworks](https://stackoverflow.com/a/27704409){:target="_blank"} have struggled to wrestle with.
While efforts have been made by several CSS toolkits to offer a[ high level of customization](https://bulma.io/documentation/customize/list-of-sass-variables/){:target="_blank"} it can be quite overwhelming and laborious to make these changes.
With Tailwind CSS, existing libraries such as [Class Variance Authority](https://cva.style/){:target="_blank"}, [Tailwind Merge](https://github.com/dcastil/tailwind-merge){:target="_blank"}, and [Tailwind Variants](https://www.tailwind-variants.org/){:target="_blank"},
address class management and variants, but they do not make it easy to extend and completely own a design system.

A more structured and programmatic approach is needed to bridge the flexibility of Tailwind CSS with full control and extensibility of an inherited design system.

[Jade Garden](https://github.com/project-jade-garden/jade-garden) is a collection of tools for developing with Headless Design Systems.
It is a modification of Class Variance Authority and Tailwind Variants that has been extended to make design systems truly portable and fully customizable.
While the library can be used in any case for managing a string, it truly shines when paired with the plugin to generates CSS stylesheets for Tailwind CSS.

## Comparisons

::note
If you believe this information can be improved, feel free to suggest changes using the "Edit this page" link at the bottom of this page.

The goal of Jade Garden is to expand the capabilities of creating design systems that are portable and can be fully owned by developers.
This is done by adding enhancements with the [`create`](essentials#create) functions for wrapping your own class merge algorithm, generating typed style configurations, and generating class names when using a stylesheet.

Jade Garden has aimed for full compatability with Class Variance Authority and Tailwind Variants.
This has been achieved by using Class Variance Authority and Tailwind Variants test code.

If you want an immediate comparison between Jade Garden and it's counterpart libraries, bundle sizes and performance benchmarks are a nice contrast to compare.

## Gratitude

- [Ark UI](https://ark-ui.com/){:target="_blank"} ([Chakra UI](https://github.com/chakra-ui){:target="_blank"})<br/>
A special thank you and shout out to the Chakra organization.
This project started out as Spark CSS, a structured design system for Ark UI, and was a significant motivation to create tools for Headless Design Systems.
As it evolved to Jade Garden, [Panda CSS](https://panda-css.com/){:target="_blank"} became a massive inspiration to building a reusable design system with Tailwind CSS.
So much so, the [`sva` function name came from Panda](https://panda-css.com/docs/concepts/slot-recipes){:target="_blank"}.
To [Segun](https://github.com/segunadebayo){:target="_blank"}, and the Chakra organization, your open-source contributions are immensely appreciated!

- [Class Variance Authority](https://cva.style/){:target="_blank"} ([Joe Bell](https://github.com/joe-bell/cva){:target="_blank"})<br/>
Thank you to Joe Bell for the creation of this amazing library!
Similar to your acknowledgement of [Bill Criswell](https://github.com/crswll){:target="_blank"} ([clb](https://github.com/crswll/clb){:target="_blank"}), I originally wanted to contribute toward your project.
However, there were enhancements I wanted to make that would include contributing to Tailwind Variants, adding more projects to maintain and keep in-sync.
In addition to your updates with [`cva` (*beta*)](https://beta.cva.style/), a better path forward was to create a new project building on your work.
Thank you for your contributions to the front-end community.

- [clsx](https://github.com/lukeed/clsx){:target="_blank"} ([Luke Edwards](https://github.com/lukeed){:target="_blank"})<br/>
The mighty, simple, and underappreciated library that has been [installed on many projects over the years](https://npmtrends.com/clsx).
Jade Garden has reimplemented `clsx` and `clsx/lite` for use across the project.
Thank you for creating this library, and making developers lives more simple!

- [es-toolkit](https://es-toolkit.dev/){:target="_blank"} ([Toss](https://github.com/toss){:target="_blank"})<br/>
One of the best projects I found that modernizes lodash utilities.
Jade Garden had used `es-toolkit` to make working with JavaScript a breeze, and inspired some functions ([`cm`](/usage/class-utils#cm)), all while barely increasing the final bundle size.
While this package has been removed to achive zero dependencies, it cannot be understated how useful `es-toolkit` is for developers.
Massive shoutout and thank you!

- [Tailwind Variants](https://www.tailwind-variants.org/){:target="_blank"} ([Hero UI](https://github.com/heroui-inc){:target="_blank"})<br/>
Thank you to the contributors of Tailwind Variants. You have simplified the development of complex components and inspired a solution for complex CSS rulesets in `unplugin-jade-garden`.

- [Unplugin](https://unplugin.unjs.io/){:target="_blank"} ([UnJS](https://github.com/unjs){:target="_blank"})<br/>
A special thank you to the contributors of Unplugin! Unplugin has simplified the development of multiple build/bundle plugins under one output.
A special shoutout to the UnJS community for developing Unplugin, along with many amazing and underappreciated libraries that are used for building libraries and frameworks.
Be sure to visit [their ecosystem](https://unjs.io/packages){:target="_blank"} and star their projects!
