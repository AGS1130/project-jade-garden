Spark CSS was previously a project that provided [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) themes to build styled [Ark UI](ark-ui.com) components.
It relied on ~~[@ark-ui/anatomy](https://github.com/chakra-ui/ark/commit/9f132ad71ab0a0f725c9743879199ddd10566c4b)~~ [@zag-js/anatomy](https://github.com/chakra-ui/zag/tree/main/packages/anatomy) to provide helpful structures for writing Tailwind classes.
However, the approach to build out an **"API"** for headless design systems was naive. While it did provide typed slots to make designing headless components more easy to understand and maintain, **it did not provide an extensible way of sharing the styles, themes, and ui**.
This project will be reworked and thought out further.

TBD.
