<h1 align="center">Tailwind CSS themes built for Ark UI</h1>
<br />

Spark CSS is a comprehensive library of [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) themes to build styled [Ark UI](ark-ui.com) components. Ark UI is a headless UI library which means every component is capable of building complex and interactive interfaces. However, **Ark UI components do not include any styling**. With Spark CSS, Ark UI components can be styled easily thanks to the ~~[@ark-ui/anatomy](https://github.com/chakra-ui/ark/commit/9f132ad71ab0a0f725c9743879199ddd10566c4b)~~ [@zag-js/anatomy](https://github.com/chakra-ui/zag/tree/main/packages/anatomy) package that provides helpful structures for writing Tailwind classes. Spark CSS is consistent, flexible, and easy to use.

-   All themes are typed `slots` objects with [JSDoc annotations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPOHY-cZ1wE).
-   Compatible with [clsx](https://github.com/lukeed/clsx), [CVA](https://cva.style/docs), [Tailwind Merge](https://github.com/dcastil/tailwind-merge), and [Tailwind Variants](https://www.tailwind-variants.org/).
-   Includes [`@apply` directives](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/reusing-styles#extracting-classes-with-apply) if you want to apply styles in a CSS file.
-   Want to create a theme? [Install core library](./pkgs/core), [degit a theme](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit), and it's yours.
