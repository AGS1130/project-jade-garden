[`jade-garden`](./core) includes [`clsx`, `clsx/lite`, and their types](https://github.com/lukeed/clsx/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file#modes) out of the box,
along with modified versions of [`cva`](https://beta.cva.style/) and [`tailwind-variants`](https://www.tailwind-variants.org/).

[`unplugin-jade-garden`](./plugins) is a plugin for your build tools that writes Tailwind CSS
[`@apply` directives](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/functions-and-directives#apply-directive) without the need to manually match classes, their props, and types.
